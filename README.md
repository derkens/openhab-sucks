My attemp at controlling Ecovacs vacuum cleaners from OpenHAB

At this small start, I'm basing the communication with Ecovacs on the great sucks library by @wpietri

# Installation

1. Follow the instructions at https://github.com/wpietri/sucks, basically pip install sucks

2. Run sucks login, in order to generate the necesary sucks.conf config file

3. TEST that you can run sucks correctly

4. Clone this script

git clone https://github.com/guillebot/openhab-sucks/
